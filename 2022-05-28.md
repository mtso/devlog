what in the world is the point of this:
```zig
            const set = struct {
                fn set(_fd: os.socket_t, level: u32, option: u32, value: c_int) !void {
                    try os.setsockopt(_fd, level, option, &mem.toBytes(value));
                }
            }.set;
```

does this suggest that all replicas connect to their socket? (as a server)
and then messages are sent to those addresses from other replicas? (and thus
any server can initiate messages to that socket whenever?)

do those replicas just continually try to access peers at the socket?
