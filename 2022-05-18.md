BOOK Working Identity

Decided to finish the raw HTTP server implementation and deploy what I have.
https://github.com/mtso/devlog/blob/main/server/src/main.zig

One of the ways to deploy a binary to fly.io is to create a docker image
with the binary from the base `ubuntu` image. The binary can be built on
the host system and then copied into the image.

My first attempt to do this failed because the built binary targeted macos.
So I needed to rebuild the binary targeting the triple `x86_64-linux-gnu`.
I couldn't figure out how to configure build.zig to do this via `zig build` directly.
So I turned to the quicker and dirtier option via the zig build-exe command.
For now it works and lets me move on :)

One security problem of the simple implementation is that
one can access some the server file system via the HTTP path location.
You can see this in action via `curl --output main https://devlog.fly.dev/main`,
which downloads the server binary itself ðŸ’©. I may fix this later.
