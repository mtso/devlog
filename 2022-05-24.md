Quorum

ME A quorum is two nodes agreeing on each other


Under the assumptions of quorum intersection (i.e., that every two quorums intersect at a
well-behaved participant)
- https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/Classes/739/Papers/QuorumsOrigin.pdf

Given a set of nodes, typically servers, a quorum system is a
collections of subsets of nodes, called quorums, every two of which intersect.
- https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~remzi/Classes/739/Papers/QuorumsOrigin.pdf

A quorum system is a collection of subsets of nodes, called quorums,
with the property that each pair of quorums have a non-empty intersection.
Quorum systems are the key mathematical abstraction for ensuring consistency in fault-tolerant and highly available distributed computing. This paper is a brief overview of the evolution of quorum systems, with emphasis
on their role in two fundamental applications: distributed storage and replication.

a viewstamp is used to distinguish between a call that survives into a new view and can be committed versus a call that does not survive and must be aborte

a view is a group of cohorts that are connected over network with info on a primary;
this group is a subset of the config.
one or more cohorts could be unreachable
in the view as long as they are a majority of the
the total group.

timestamps need not match the literal epoch time
and so thus can be an incrementing counter
as long as the timestamps are strictly increasing

communication buffer provides a reliable way
for a primary to deliver event records to
all backups in the primary's view; and a successful
delivery to all known backups in the view is required!
a failure in the event delivery causes a view change!
the failure can be a backup crash or a
network fault!

each node maintains a history of the viewstamps
and each node's state is a state machine that
reflects events from views applied to its
state IF AND ONLY IF the event's timestamp
is less than or equal to the view's timestamp?

harp fs (by liskov) builds on top of viewstamp replication
https://pmg.csail.mit.edu/papers/harp.pdf


KEY differences
- VR 1 explains in terms of "transaction processing" and "changing views"
- VR revisited explains in terms of "normal operation" and "view changes" and also adds "replica recovery" and "client recovery" (request numbers)
  - and then goes on to add additional info on both read/write optimizations
    as well as reconfiguration protocol and discusses correctness of view changes, the recovery and reconfiguration protocols

how can i optimize for learning technical skills on the job

is it possible to depriotize earnings now in exchange
