step 5: primary waits for f PrepareOk messages from different backups! doesn't have to be the same replicas within a view (which was what i previously thought)
slow replicas accounted for by state transfer in step 4

The fundamental
theorem of quorum intersection states that its resilience is inversely proportional
to the load on (hence the throughput of) participants [31].

VR as originally defined used a slightly different approach: it assigned each oper- ation a viewstamp
VR revisited sets an op-number per client request? where each client request message can contain one or more operations?

a view change during recovery protocol, where recovering replica that is added to
node configs; the recovering replica will be skipped because it cannot send
DoViewChange messages. skip meaning that a second view change will occur
