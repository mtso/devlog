nodejs raft impl with leveldb

interesting note on flexible paxos and how tigerbeetle uses synchronous replication

primary sends "prepare" to next replica, and the next replica is responsible for sending to the next after that
primary receives prepare_ok messages from next replica and each subsequent one.

interesting that the next leader candidate is the immediately following replica, and thus
making sure that that replica always gets the latest prepare message from leader
