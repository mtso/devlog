rrrrrrrr stack

rrrrrrrr stands for React.js, Redux, Rust, Rocket.rs, Redis, Rethinkdb, Rabbitmq, Raspbian

But the structure supports swapping or adding any technology that begins with the letter "R".
Popular additions are Relay Framework for the data layer, Rollup for frontend bundling, or RocksDB for embedded key-value storage.
Others may swap Rust and Rocket.rs for Ruby on Rails or Raspbian for RockyLinux.

Why RRRRRRRR?
The RRRRRRRR stack is a good option for tech organizations that want an
especially memorable tech stack for attracting engineering talent.

// that want to present
// consistent tech stack naming for memorable public relations.
// that want a memorable tech stack naming to help in their public relations for attacting engineering talent.

The structure is also good for full stack MVC web applications with technologies
already chosen for caching, data persistence, and message queuing.
