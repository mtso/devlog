CHANGE fixed text encoding of returned files to support unicode emojis; set content-type to charset=UTF-8

Serving the index, list of available files on the server.
Length is unknown ahead of time because of iterator interface (ends when call to next no longer returns an entry).
Tried text/event-stream for server-sent events. But this was unreliable (sometimes entries were stopped along the way) even when Cache-Control was set to no-cache.
Tried Transfer-Encoding: chunked next
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Transfer-Encoding
The 0\r\n\r\n is required to signal the end of the chunks! Otherwise, chrome logs an ERR_ transfer encoding error on client side.


Implementing bitcask log structure hash table
Need to serialize and deserialize from struct to file bytes.

const Chunk = packed struct {
    id: u128,
};

const chunkarr = [@sizeOf(Chunk)]u8; 
const chunk = Chunk{
    .id = 123,
};
var bytes: chunkarr = @bitCast(chunkarr, chunk);
